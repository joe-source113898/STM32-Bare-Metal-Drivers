## Introduction

The STM32F407 Discovery board is a development board based on the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. This repository provides drivers for the GPIO and SPI peripherals, enabling easy and efficient manipulation of these hardware features.

## Features

- GPIO Driver:
  - Configure GPIO pins as input, output, or alternate function
  - Enable or disable internal pull-up/pull-down resistors
  - Read and write digital values to GPIO pins

- SPI Driver:
  - Initialize and configure the SPI peripheral
  - Transmit and receive data using SPI
  - Support for multiple SPI modes and clock speeds

## Requirements

- STM32F407 Discovery board
- STM32CubeIDE or other compatible development environment
- ARM GCC toolchain
- OpenOCD or other flashing tool
